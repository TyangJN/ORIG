    "txt_reference": "The German gentian, Gentianella germanica, was the county flower of Buckinghamshire in England.\nThe plant is an annual or biennial species, 5 to 40 cm tall.\nThe stems are mostly unbranched or with very few branches.\nWhen biennial, the first year produces a basal rosette of leaves, which wither before flowering.\nThe stem leaves are opposite, deep green, and taper to a sharp point.\nThe leaf shape varies from ovate to ovate-lanceolate or ovate-triangular.\nThe flowers grow singly from the axils of the leaves.\nThe flowers are funnel-shaped and usually reddish-violet, though occasionally white.\nEach flower is about 3.5 cm long.\nThe sepals are partly fused at the base, dividing into five pointed lobes.\nThe corolla tube divides into five pointed petal lobes, sometimes only four.\nThe petal lobes are up to 15 mm long with slightly rough edges.\nInside the floral tube, a ring of long hairs is visible.\nEach flower has five stamens and two stigmas in the throat.\nA single plant can produce from 4 to over 40 flowers during the season.\n",
