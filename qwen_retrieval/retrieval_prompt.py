CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Identify ONLY the key entities/concepts that require clarification.
2. Write 1-3 short sub-questions (prefer 1 if possible) asking for definitions or main characteristics.
3. Generate 1 matching search query per sub-question.

MANDATORY OUTPUT FORMAT:
<Thought>
List the key entities/concepts from the input prompt that need basic factual clarification.

<Sub-Questions>
Write 1-3 sub-questions, each on its own line, asking "What is X?" or "What are the main characteristics of X?"

STRICT RULES:
- Search queries MUST be short, natural-language search terms or questions
- Must match the number of sub-questions (1-to-1 mapping, in the same order)
- Use normal text, NO square brackets, NO bullet numbers
- Focus on definitions, taxonomy, basic appearance, main stages — not detailed measurements, colors, or processes
- NO image-related terms ("photo", "image", "pictures")

"""


loop_search_first = """
CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Work strictly on entities, scenes, and factual information mentioned or strongly implied in the input prompt.
2. Generate retrievals ONLY for missing or unclear elements (avoid redundancy with existing knowledge).
3. Choose retrieval type deliberately:
   - Use TEXT retrieval for factual descriptions of visual characteristics, design principles, historical context that informs visual appearance, or process steps that have visual outcomes
   - Use IMAGE retrieval for direct visual references, style examples, material textures, or spatial layout demonstrations
4. Keep total queries to 1–3 (prefer fewer, high-value searches).

---

MANDATORY OUTPUT FORMAT:
<Thought>
Break down the prompt into categories:
- Perceptual Features: color, shape, size, texture, posture, position
- Scene & Objects: number of entities, environment, background, relationships
- Temporal Processes: actions, sequences, transformations, historical stages
- Stylistic Attributes: visual style, aesthetic tone, composition

Then explicitly list:
- Missing elements needing TEXT retrieval (facts, definitions, context)
- Missing elements needing IMAGE retrieval (appearance, style, layout)

Briefly justify why each missing element is assigned to TEXT or IMAGE retrieval.
</Thought>

<Sub-Questions>
Write 1–3 atomic questions for missing elements, in priority order:
- Text questions: "What is X?", "What are main characteristics of X?", "What is the process or stages of X?"...
- Image questions: Short, direct queries (3–10 words, focus on appearance/style/layout)

Each question must relate directly to prompt entities or implied style/scene.

</Image Retrievals>

Use both TEXT and IMAGE retrievals as appropriate. Leave a section empty only if no queries are truly needed for that type.
</Search Plan>

---

STRICT RULES:

For Text Retrieval:
- Target definitions, taxonomy, characteristics, processes, or symbolic/cultural meaning
- No image-related words ("photo", "image", "pictures")
- Use concise, natural-language queries suitable for factual search

For Image Retrieval:
- Target concrete, observable attributes: appearance, material, style, composition
- Include detail level or perspective if relevant 
- Keep short, specific, 3–10 words
- Avoid abstract or metaphorical language

General:
- Do NOT generate unrelated or overly broad queries
- Explicitly match sub-questions to search queries (1-to-1, in order)
- Cover the most critical missing visual/semantic information first
- If style is mentioned (e.g. "cyberpunk"), you may combine TEXT (to clarify style features) + IMAGE (to gather visual style examples)
- Max 1–5 total queries for both modalities

MANDATORY OUTPUT FORMAT:

<Sufficiency Evaluation>
Assess the current knowledge for image generation readiness across these dimensions:
- All key entities have clear definitions or descriptions
- Visual characteristics, style, and context are sufficiently detailed
