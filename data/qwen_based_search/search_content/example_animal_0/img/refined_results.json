  "prompts": "**T2I Prompt (Text-to-Image):**\n\n\"Create a visually detailed, educational diagram illustrating the complete life cycle of a frog in a circular flow layout, set against a warm golden-yellow background. The image should consist of four distinct, rounded-corner photographic panels arranged in a clockwise cycle, each connected by bold blue arrows indicating progression.  \n\n1. **Top-left panel (EGG):** A close-up photograph of frog eggs clustered together in water, translucent with greenish-white gelatinous sacs visible, surrounded by dark aquatic vegetation. Label 'EGG' in a clean white oval with blue border and blue uppercase text.\n\n2. **Top-right panel (TADPOLE):** A clear image of a tadpole swimming in murky green water, showing its elongated tail, small head, and developing eyes. The surrounding environment includes submerged leaves and algae. Label 'TADPOLE' in the same style as above.\n\n3. **Bottom-right panel (FROGLET):** A young froglet transitioning from tadpole to frog, with a shortening tail, fully formed legs, and a yellowish-green body. It is perched on mossy aquatic plants. Label 'FROGLET' in matching label design.\n\n4. **Bottom-left panel (FROG):** An adult green tree frog resting on a plant stem, vividly colored with dark spots, large eyes, and strong limbs, representing maturity. Label 'FROG' in consistent format.\n\nEnsure all images are high-resolution, realistic, and photorealistic with natural lighting. The layout must be symmetrical and balanced, with soft drop shadows under each panel to create depth. Use clean sans-serif font for labels. Style: scientific illustration meets nature photography â€” informative, vibrant, and engaging for educational purposes.\"\n\n---\n\n**Control Parameters Embedded:**\n- **Layout:** Circular flow with 4 quadrants, clockwise direction.\n- **Visual Style:** Photorealistic + educational infographic.\n- **Color Palette:** Golden-yellow background; blue arrows; white labels with blue borders.\n- **Text Elements:** Four labeled stages (\"EGG\", \"TADPOLE\", \"FROGLET\", \"FROG\") in standardized format.\n- **Subject Details:** Realistic depictions at each life stage with accurate anatomy and habitat context.\n- **Composition:** Symmetrical, balanced, with visual continuity via arrows and shadow effects.\n\nThis prompt ensures precise control over structure, content, and aesthetics for consistent generation across AI image models."
