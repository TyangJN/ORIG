Eggs are laid in water, often in clusters called frogspawn, and develop into tadpoles that hatch with gills and live fully aquatic lives. Tadpoles grow legs, develop lungs, and absorb their tail as they transform into froglets—small frogs with a short tail capable of living on land. Finally, the froglet matures into an adult frog with strong legs, no tail, and the ability to live both on land and in water. This transformation is known as metamorphosis.\n        "
