sequential transformation implied via arrows\n  - Frogs depicted independently in environment, not interacting with other frogs\n- Subject-object interactions:\n  - Eggs float on water surface among plants\n  - Tadpoles swim near vegetation\n  - Froglets cling to stems or rest on leaves\n  - Adult frogs sit atop lily pads or branches\n- Environmental interactions:\n  - Water surface reflects sky and foliage\n  - Plants provide structure and shelter\n  - Mud bank visible beneath water line\n\nSpatial Control:\n- Precise positioning and relationships:\n  - Stages arranged in clockwise circular flow around central void\n  - Each panel contains one primary subject centered with environmental context\n  - Arrows positioned between panels to indicate transition direction\n- Depth layers and scale proportions:\n  - Foreground: main subject (frog, tadpole, etc.)\n  - Midground: aquatic plants, lily pads\n  - Background: softly blurred water and vegetation\n  - Scale consistent across all stages—no distortion\n- Movement and directional flow:\n  - Arrows guide viewer’s eye in clockwise motion\n  - Slight orientation cues: tadpoles facing forward, froglets climbing upward\n\nScene Control:\n- Environmental context and elements:\n  - Shallow freshwater pond with calm surface\n  - Lily pads floating on surface\n  - Submerged reeds and grasses\n  - Muddy shoreline visible at bottom edge\n  - Yellow water lily flower present\n- Atmospheric conditions and lighting:\n  - Bright daylight with soft shadows\n  - Diffuse sunlight reflecting off water\n  - No harsh contrasts or artificial lighting\n- Props, furniture, architectural details:\n  - Natural props only: plants, water, mud\n  - No man-made objects or structures\n\nStyle Control:\n- Visual style and aesthetic direction:\n  - Photorealistic style preferred over cartoon\n  - Accurate representation of biological features\n  - Smooth gradients and realistic texture mapping\n- Color palette and mood:\n  - Dominant colors: green (frogs, plants), blue (water), brown (mud), white (eggs)\n  - Calm, educational tone with natural vibrancy\n- Composition and framing:\n  - Balanced, symmetrical layout\n  - White borders around each panel enhance separation\n  - Central negative space allows for titling\n\nPriority Elements:\n- Most critical control points, ranked by importance:\n  1. Accurate depiction of each life stage (anatomy, size, color)\n  2. Correct sequence and directional flow (clockwise arrows)\n  3. Realistic environmental context (pond, plants, water)\n  4. Clear labeling without obstruction\n  5. Consistent lighting and depth of field\n- Negative constraints: avoid...\n  - Cartoonish or exaggerated features\n  - Misplaced or missing labels\n  - Distorted anatomy (e.g., wrong leg count, misplaced tail)\n  - Artificial backgrounds or studio-like lighting\n  - Crowded or overlapping elements\n</GenerationGuidance>",

  "prompts": "<final_prompt>\nPhotorealistic circular diagram of the frog life cycle, arranged in four quarter-circle panels on a warm yellow background, each with a white border and subtle drop shadow. Clockwise sequence: EGG → TADPOLE → FROGLET → FROG, connected by bold blue arrows. Top-left panel shows translucent green frogspawn eggs floating on water surface, surrounded by aquatic plants, with visible black embryos inside; labeled “EGG” in a light blue rounded box. Top-right panel features a tadpole with long tail and gills swimming near submerged vegetation, slightly blurred background for depth; labeled “TADPOLE”. Bottom-right panel displays a froglet with four legs and shrinking tail perched on a plant stem, semi-aquatic posture; labeled “FROGLET”. Bottom-left panel presents an adult green frog with smooth skin, large eyes, and strong hind legs resting on a lily pad above water; labeled “FROG”. All subjects centered within their segments, consistent scale, natural lighting, soft shadows, and shallow depth of field. Environment includes calm freshwater pond with floating lily pads, submerged reeds, muddy bank, and a yellow water lily flower. Realistic textures, accurate anatomy, no cartoonish features, no man-made objects. Labels positioned clearly without obstruction. Central empty space allows for optional title. Style: high-resolution photorealism, natural color palette (greens, blues, browns), educational tone.\n</final_prompt>"
