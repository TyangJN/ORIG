      "coarse_filtered_content": "The frog life cycle consists of four stages: egg, tadpole, froglet, and adult frog. Eggs are laid in water, often in clusters called frogspawn, and develop into tadpoles that hatch with gills and live fully aquatic lives. Tadpoles grow legs, develop lungs, and absorb their tail as they transform into frogletsâ€”small frogs with a short tail capable of living on land. Finally, the froglet matures into an adult frog with strong legs, no tail, and the ability to live both on land and in water. This transformation is known as metamorphosis.\n\nThe typical visual arrangement of a frog life cycle is circular or linear, showing sequential progression from egg to adult, often placed around a central pond or wetland environment. Key environmental elements include freshwater ponds, aquatic plants (like lily pads), mud, and surrounding vegetation such as reeds and grasses. The common visual style in educational materials is photorealistic or semi-realistic illustrations with clear labeling, natural lighting, and realistic textures to depict each stage accurately within a shared habitat context."
