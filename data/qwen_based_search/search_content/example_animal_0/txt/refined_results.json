The scene is set in a natural wetland environment during daytime with soft, natural lighting and realistic textures.\n\n1. **Central Element**: A calm, reflective freshwater pond with visible ripples, surrounded by green aquatic plants including lily pads, reeds, and water grasses. Mud banks and damp soil line the edges. Include small insects like dragonflies and mayflies to enhance ecological realism.\n\n2. **Life Cycle Stages (Clockwise Arrangement)**:\n   - **Stage 1 – Frog Eggs (Frogspawn)**: A cluster of translucent, gelatinous eggs floating on the water surface near submerged vegetation. Each egg contains a tiny black embryo; show several developing stages within the cluster.\n   - **Stage 2 – Tadpole**: A fully formed tadpole swimming in the pond, with a large tail, gills visible behind the head, no legs yet. Surround it with algae and small aquatic organisms.\n   - **Stage 3 – Froglet**: A young frog with a short tail, developing hind legs, and beginning to grow front legs. Positioned at the edge of the pond, partially on land, transitioning from water to land.\n   - **Stage 4 – Adult Frog**: A fully mature green frog with strong hind legs, no tail, sitting on a lily pad or mossy bank. Show detailed skin texture, moist eyes, and natural posture.\n\n3. **Visual Style & Details**:\n   - Render in high resolution (8K) with hyperrealistic textures, accurate coloration (green, brown, yellow), and depth of field.\n   - Use natural lighting (golden hour sunlight filtering through trees) casting soft shadows.\n   - Background includes tall grasses, shrubs, and distant trees to establish a forested wetland habitat.\n   - Add subtle motion blur to water ripples and gentle breeze effects on leaves for dynamism.\n\n4. **Labeling & Educational Clarity**:\n   - Include clean, legible labels in white sans-serif font with semi-transparent black outline: “Egg”, “Tadpole”, “Froglet”, “Adult Frog” placed near each stage.\n   - Optional: Arrows indicating the direction of metamorphosis flow.\n\n5. **Composition**:\n   - Circular layout centered on the pond; all stages evenly spaced along the perimeter.\n   - Perspective slightly elevated to view both water and land areas clearly.\n   - Depth layering: foreground (froglet and adult), midground (pond and tadpole), background (vegetation and sky).\n\n6. **Technical Parameters (for AI model control)**:\n   - Aspect Ratio: 16:9\n   - Style: Photorealistic, nature documentary style\n   - Mood: Calm, educational, serene\n   - Color Palette: Earth tones (greens, browns, blues), natural saturation\n   - Avoid: Cartoonish features, exaggerated proportions, artificial colors\n\n7. **Negative Prompt**:\n   - No cartoon characters, fantasy elements, text overlays beyond labels, human figures, or non-natural settings (e.g., urban, desert).\n   - Exclude symmetry unless implied by natural patterns; avoid overly stylized or abstract art.\n\n8. **Output Purpose**:\n   - Suitable for biology textbooks, science education materials, or wildlife documentaries.\n   - Ensure clarity and visual accuracy for scientific interpretation.\n```\n\n---\n\n**Usage Note**: This prompt can be directly fed into advanced T2I models (e.g., Stable Diffusion, DALL·E 3, Midjourney v6) with additional control nets (e.g., depth map, pose, segmentation) for fine-tuning. For maximum control, use tools like ControlNet (depth, openpose, scribble) to enforce layout structure and anatomical precision."
