Eggs are laid in water, often in clusters called frogspawn, and develop into tadpoles that hatch with gills and live fully aquatic lives. Tadpoles grow legs, develop lungs, and absorb their tail as they transform into froglets—small frogs with a short tail capable of living on land. Finally, the froglet matures into an adult frog with strong legs, no tail, and the ability to live both on land and in water. This transformation is known as metamorphosis.",

The eggs are surrounded by a jelly-like substance that protects them and keeps them moist. Inside, the embryos develop tails and begin to take on a comma shape before hatching.\n\n2. **Tadpole Stage**: After hatching, the young frogs are called tadpoles. They live entirely in water, breathe through gills, and feed on plants. Over time, they grow hind legs first, then front legs, while their tail gradually shrinks. Lungs develop internally, allowing them to breathe air.\n\n3. **Froglet Stage**: As the tail disappears, the creature becomes a froglet—resembling a small frog with a short tail. It can now survive on land thanks to fully developed lungs and begins eating insects. This stage marks the transition from aquatic to semi-terrestrial life.\n\n4. **Adult Frog Stage**: The froglet matures into an adult frog over several months to years (up to four years). Adults have no tail, strong legs for jumping, and can live both on land and in water. Female adult frogs eventually lay eggs, restarting the cycle.\n\nThis process is known as **metamorphosis**, a transformation common among amphibians and some insects. Frogs absorb water through their skin, do not drink it, and have lifespans ranging from 2 to over 20 years depending on species."
