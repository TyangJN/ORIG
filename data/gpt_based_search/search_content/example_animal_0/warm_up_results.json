Eggs: translucent jelly clumps (frogspawn) floating in shallow water with tiny black embryos that become comma-shaped as tails form. Tadpoles: dark, fish-like bodies with long tails and gill structures, shown underwater among submerged plants. Froglet/transition: visible hind then front legs, lungs forming, tail noticeably shortening—often half in water/half on a wet rock or leaf. Adult: fully formed four-legged frog perched on a lily pad or bank with moist skin; compose elements in a circular/sequential layout or a panoramic pond edge, include reeds, lily pads, surface reflections, and size cues (tiny eggs, small tadpoles, thumb-sized froglets, larger adults) for realistic scale.",

Inside each jelly bead is a small black embryo; older eggs look comma-shaped as a tail forms. Female frogs may lay hundreds to thousands of eggs in a single clutch.\n- Stage 2 — Tadpole: newly hatched, fish-like body with a long tail and external gills (later internalized). Lives and breathes underwater, often near submerged plants; eats algae/plant material early on. Color typically dark or mottled.\n- Stage 3 — Tadpole with legs / Froglet transition: hind legs develop first, then front legs; lungs form and a skin layer covers gills; tail shortens as nutrients are reabsorbed. This rapid final transformation can occur quickly (final change sometimes within ~24 hours).\n- Stage 4 — Froglet to Adult frog: froglet resembles a small frog but may retain a short tail; adult has four fully formed legs, no tail, functional lungs, moist permeable skin, and a long sticky tongue for catching insects. Adults return to water to breed and lay eggs, repeating the cycle.\n\nKey biological facts (for accuracy)\n- This is an example of metamorphosis (major body reshaping across life stages).\n- Habitat: freshwater bodies with vegetation (pond edges, lily pads, reeds).\n- Timing: tadpole stage often lasts weeks to months (varies by species and conditions); full maturation to adult can take months to years depending on species.\n- Eggs are protected and nourished by jelly; tadpoles breathe via gills, adults via lungs (and skin moisture helps water balance).\n- Appearance varies by species (e.g., poison dart frogs have bright adults), but the structural stages above are typical.\n\nVisual cues for a single “frog life circle” photo (essential elements)\n- Composition: circular/sequential layout with four clear panels or segments (eggs → tadpole → tadpole-with-legs/froglet → adult frog), or a single panoramic scene showing each stage around a pond edge.\n- Egg visual: close-up of translucent jelly clump with visible black embryos/comma shapes, floating at/near surface among pond vegetation.\n- Tadpole visual: underwater shot showing small dark, fish-like bodies with long tails and faint gill structures, near submerged plants.\n- Transition/froglet visual: a tadpole with visible hind and front legs and a noticeably shortening tail, half in water/half on a wet rock or leaf.\n- Adult visual: fully formed frog perched on a lily pad or bank (moist skin, four legs, green/brown coloration typical), possibly with a nearby clutch of eggs to show the cycle.\n- Environment & mood: shallow freshwater, green reeds/lily pads, natural daylight reflections on water, slight surface ripples and underwater plant detail to indicate habitat continuity between stages.\n- Scale hints: eggs are tiny clustered beads; tadpoles are small relative to leaves/stems; froglets are thumb-sized; adults noticeably larger—use nearby plants or a finger-sized cue for realism.\n\nUse these factual stage descriptions and visual cues to create an accurate, naturalistic photo representing the frog life cycle."
