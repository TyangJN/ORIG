Arrange the four stages in a circular, clockwise sequence around a central lily pad in a shallow freshwater pond. Perspective is a slightly elevated top‑down angle (about 30–45°) with a square composition so all stages are clearly visible. Environment features clear shallow water with reeds, lily pads, submerged aquatic plants, small pebbles and mud on the pond bed, and gentle surface reflections.\n\nClockwise stage placement and depiction:\n- 12 o’clock — Eggs (frogspawn): translucent jelly clumps floating in very shallow water near the surface, each egg with a tiny black embryo; some embryos already comma‑shaped as tails form; include microbubbles and a slight water meniscus around the clumps; smallest scale.\n- 3 o’clock — Tadpoles: several dark, fish‑like bodies with long tails and visible external gill frills, swimming just below the surface among submerged plants; clear water reveals them underwater with subtle caustics and suspended silt motes; small scale.\n- 6 o’clock — Froglet (transition): positioned half in water and half out on a wet rock or leaf at the pond edge; hind legs fully visible first, front legs emerging, tail noticeably shortening; moist skin texture; about thumb‑sized.\n- 9 o’clock — Adult frog: fully formed with four legs and smooth, moist skin; perched on a lily pad or grassy bank; larger than froglet; natural green‑brown coloration with subtle skin pores and highlights.\n\nVisual continuity and cues:\n- Gentle circular ripples guide the eye clockwise through the stages.\n- Clear separation between stages while remaining part of one natural scene.\n- Scale cues preserved: eggs smallest, tadpoles small, froglet thumb‑sized, adult larger.\n- Background stays natural and unobtrusive; no human‑made objects.\n\nLighting and color:\n- Soft overcast daylight for even illumination, no harsh shadows; mild specular highlights on water; natural greens and browns with subtle teal‑olive water tones.\n- High micro‑detail on jelly transparency, tadpole gills, skin moisture, and plant textures.\n\nCamera and rendering guidance:\n- Lens equivalent ~40–50mm; deep depth of field (focus‑stacked look) so all stages are sharp.\n- Polarizing‑filter effect to reduce glare while retaining some reflections.\n- High resolution, clean, crisp, 4k+ detail, photographic realism.\n\nNegative prompt:\ncartoon, illustration, CGI, 3D render, painting, low detail, blur, shallow DOF, harsh contrast, oversaturated, incorrect anatomy, algae bloom obscuring subjects, pollution, multiple adult frogs, arrows, icons, labels, borders, watermark, text\n\nRecommended parameters:\n- Aspect ratio: 1:1\n- Style: photorealistic, field nature photography\n- Lighting: soft daylight, overcast\n- Focus: deep DOF, focus stacking\n- Seed/variation: fixed seed for consistency (optional)"
