Arrange them in a circular sequential layout or as a panoramic scene along a pond edge for clarity.\n\nEnvironment and context:\n- Shallow freshwater setting with reeds, lily pads, submerged plants, and surface reflections.\n\nStage details:\n- Eggs: translucent jelly clumps floating in shallow water; tiny black embryos inside, some becoming comma-shaped as tails form.\n- Tadpoles: dark, fish-like bodies with long tails and gill structures; shown underwater among submerged plants.\n- Froglet (transition): hind legs visible first, then front legs; tail noticeably shortening; often positioned half in water and half on a wet rock or leaf.\n- Adult frog: fully formed four legs and moist skin; perched on a lily pad or on the bank.\n\nScale cues:\n- Eggs smallest, tadpoles small, froglets about thumb-sized, adults larger."
