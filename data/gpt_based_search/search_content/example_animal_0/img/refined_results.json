  "prompts": "Highly controllable T2I prompt\n\nConcept\n- Ultra‑realistic natural history photograph showing the frog life cycle in one continuous scene at the edge of a shallow pond, progressing left to right: eggs → free‑swimming tadpoles → tadpole with legs → froglet on shore → adult frog.\n\nLayout and subject placement\n- Aspect ratio: 3:2 horizontal. Resolution target: 2048×1365 or higher.\n- Camera angle: very low, slightly above the waterline, using a half‑submerged housing so the frame shows both underwater and shoreline seamlessly.\n- Left 20% (Stage 1 – eggs): A dense clump of gelatinous frogspawn on submerged vegetation, each egg a clear sphere with a single black embryo; sparkling surface highlights and a thin film of pond water. Match the look and density of the egg mass to reference image_0.\n- Center‑left 20% (Stage 2 – tadpoles): A small school of dark tadpoles swimming over pale stones and sand, some casting sharp silhouettes on a light rock. Use the rock-and-silhouette feel from reference image_1.\n- Center‑right 20% (Stage 3 – legged tadpole): One large tadpole resting on a pale rock, with clearly visible hind legs and small emerging forelimbs; tail still long and flexible. Shape and pose echo reference image_1, but brighter, more detailed.\n- Right 15% (Stage 4 – froglet): A tiny froglet just out of the water on a wet leaf at the shoreline; smooth moist skin, bright eyes, a small residual tail nub.\n- Far‑right background 10% (Adult): An adult frog half on a mossy rock, half in the water, slightly defocused so the focus remains on the froglet.\n- Negative space and continuity: Submerged reeds and algae guide the eye left→right; gentle ripples unify the water surface.\n\nEnvironment and materials\n- Setting: clear, shallow freshwater pond with sandy bottom, scattered pebbles, one pale limestone rock mid‑frame; sparse submerged grasses.\n- Water: clean with faint suspended particulates, small air bubbles clinging to eggs and rock edges; subtle caustic light patterns on the stones.\n- Shore: wet leaf litter, a few blades of green grass, dark soil.\n\nLighting and color\n- Time of day: late morning, bright overcast with soft dappled sun through foliage.\n- Key light: soft natural sunlight from upper left; use a polarizing look to reduce surface glare while keeping specular highlights on eggs.\n- Color palette: natural greens and browns; eggs translucent with bluish‑gray shadows; tadpoles near‑black; rocks warm beige.\n\nCamera and lens behavior\n- Real camera look, full‑frame sensor.\n- Focal length: 35 mm.\n- Aperture: f/8–f/11 for moderate depth-of-field; employ subtle focus stacking so all five stages remain acceptably sharp.\n- Shutter: 1/250 s; ISO 200.\n- Depth cues: stronger micro‑contrast and texture on the central rock; slight bokeh in distant shoreline.\n\nImage quality and style\n- Style: documentary macro‑environment photograph, not an illustration; crisp textures, fine water details, true‑to‑life colors.\n- Detail: high micro‑detail on egg capsules, tadpole skin, and froglet skin; visible pores and water droplets.\n- No text labels in the frame unless requested.\n\nReference bindings\n- Use image_0 to guide the appearance and clustering of the frogspawn (gelatinous capsules with black embryos).\n- Use image_1 to guide the rock setting and the silhouette/shape of tadpoles and the legged tadpole on the rock.\n\nNegative prompts\n- No cartoons, paintings, CGI, or infographic icons.\n- No unnatural colors, no overly shallow DOF that blurs any lifecycle stage, no extra animals, no murky water, no heavy lens flares, no human‑made objects.\n\nOptional generation parameters\n- CFG/Guidance: 6.5–8.5\n- Sampler: DPM++ or Euler a\n- Steps: 30–50\n- Seed: fixed for repeatability (e.g., 12345)\n\nOne‑line prompt (if your T2I system prefers a single string)\n“Ultra‑realistic natural history photo, low angle at a shallow pond edge, continuous left‑to‑right frog life cycle: dense translucent frogspawn with black embryos underwater (match ref image_0), then a school of dark tadpoles over a pale rock casting silhouettes (match ref image_1), then a tadpole with hind legs resting on the rock, then a tiny froglet on a wet leaf at the shoreline with a small tail nub, and an adult frog slightly defocused on a mossy rock in the background; clear freshwater with bubbles and caustic patterns, reeds and pebbles, bright overcast dappled sunlight, natural greens/browns; full‑frame 35 mm, f/8–f/11, slight focus stacking, polarized look, high detail, documentary photo, no text, no CGI.”"
