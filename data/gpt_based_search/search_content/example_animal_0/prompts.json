    "prompt": "<final_prompt>\nPhotorealistic natural‑history composite of a frog life cycle: 7 side‑by‑side panels in a left‑to‑right strip, all within one natural pond. Soft overcast daylight; underwater caustics and mild haze; pond palette of olive greens, amber water, brown silt. Maintain one consistent reed cluster and lily‑pad patch across panels to imply the same location. Subtle white numbered labels (1–7) and small arrows guide the sequence, inspired by <image_0>, but minimal and unobtrusive.\n\nEnvironment and optics: shallow water to waterside depth gradient from left to right; sandy/silty bottom with scattered pebbles and periphytic algae; submerged pondweed and vertical reeds; surface reflections and gentle ripples. One dominant subject per panel; shallow depth of field with subject crisp, background softly blurred. Macro/close lenses for early stages, moderate focal lengths for froglet/adult.\n\nPanel 1 (macro, near surface): frogspawn jelly mass wrapped around a submerged reed 5–15 cm below the surface; translucent gel with embedded black embryos, a few comma‑curled; tiny air bubbles on the jelly; overhead surface reflection. \nPanel 2 (macro): hatchling emerging from a capsule beside the egg mass; fine external filamentous gills behind the head (reddish/transparent); small translucent tail fin; several ruptured capsules nearby, suspended microbubbles. \nPanel 3 (underwater mid‑shot): larval tadpole among plants, darker dorsum; large high tail fin; opercular fold covering internal gills; no forelimbs visible; mouth grazing biofilm on a leaf/rock. \nPanel 4 (mid‑depth): two tadpoles loosely schooling near vertical reeds; hindlimb buds elongating with early toes; big translucent tail fins. \nPanel 5 (near surface): metamorphic climax; forelimb emerging from the gill chamber as the fold opens; tail shrinking with uneven translucent edges; tiny bubble at mouth; rippled surface and reflection above. \nPanel 6 (waterline): froglet perched half‑in/half‑out on a wet rock or leaf; short tail stump; water beads on toes; emergent grasses and mud bank. \nPanel 7 (surface): adult frog on an intact lily pad; moist skin; pad slightly depressed with a meniscus and concentric ripples; clear reflection.\n\nScale hierarchy: eggs 3–5 mm; hatchling body 6–10 mm; larval tadpoles larger with tails 2–3× body; froglet thumb‑sized; adult substantially larger. Gentle tail‑tip motion blur only; tadpoles oriented forward to lead the flow.\n\nAvoid: cartoon/illustrative look, heavy outlines, spherical aquarium/bowl framing, bright red dominant arrows, unnatural neon colors, glass reflections, crystal‑clear aquarium water, fish or unrelated species, mixing habitats (e.g., adult underwater), incorrect anatomy (no forelimbs before metamorphic climax; show opercular fold and correct gill stages).\n</final_prompt>",

    "prompt": "Prompt:\nUltra‑photorealistic nature photograph of the frog life cycle shown in one image. Arrange the four stages in a circular, clockwise sequence around a central lily pad in a shallow freshwater pond. Perspective is a slightly elevated top‑down angle (about 30–45°) with a square composition so all stages are clearly visible. Environment features clear shallow water with reeds, lily pads, submerged aquatic plants, small pebbles and mud on the pond bed, and gentle surface reflections.\n\nClockwise stage placement and depiction:\n- 12 o’clock — Eggs (frogspawn): translucent jelly clumps floating in very shallow water near the surface, each egg with a tiny black embryo; some embryos already comma‑shaped as tails form; include microbubbles and a slight water meniscus around the clumps; smallest scale.\n- 3 o’clock — Tadpoles: several dark, fish‑like bodies with long tails and visible external gill frills, swimming just below the surface among submerged plants; clear water reveals them underwater with subtle caustics and suspended silt motes; small scale.\n- 6 o’clock — Froglet (transition): positioned half in water and half out on a wet rock or leaf at the pond edge; hind legs fully visible first, front legs emerging, tail noticeably shortening; moist skin texture; about thumb‑sized.\n- 9 o’clock — Adult frog: fully formed with four legs and smooth, moist skin; perched on a lily pad or grassy bank; larger than froglet; natural green‑brown coloration with subtle skin pores and highlights.\n\nVisual continuity and cues:\n- Gentle circular ripples guide the eye clockwise through the stages.\n- Clear separation between stages while remaining part of one natural scene.\n- Scale cues preserved: eggs smallest, tadpoles small, froglet thumb‑sized, adult larger.\n- Background stays natural and unobtrusive; no human‑made objects.\n\nLighting and color:\n- Soft overcast daylight for even illumination, no harsh shadows; mild specular highlights on water; natural greens and browns with subtle teal‑olive water tones.\n- High micro‑detail on jelly transparency, tadpole gills, skin moisture, and plant textures.\n\nCamera and rendering guidance:\n- Lens equivalent ~40–50mm; deep depth of field (focus‑stacked look) so all stages are sharp.\n- Polarizing‑filter effect to reduce glare while retaining some reflections.\n- High resolution, clean, crisp, 4k+ detail, photographic realism.\n\nNegative prompt:\ncartoon, illustration, CGI, 3D render, painting, low detail, blur, shallow DOF, harsh contrast, oversaturated, incorrect anatomy, algae bloom obscuring subjects, pollution, multiple adult frogs, arrows, icons, labels, borders, watermark, text\n\nRecommended parameters:\n- Aspect ratio: 1:1\n- Style: photorealistic, field nature photography\n- Lighting: soft daylight, overcast\n- Focus: deep DOF, focus stacking\n- Seed/variation: fixed seed for consistency (optional)"

    "prompt": "Highly controllable T2I prompt\n\nConcept\n- Ultra‑realistic natural history photograph showing the frog life cycle in one continuous scene at the edge of a shallow pond, progressing left to right: eggs → free‑swimming tadpoles → tadpole with legs → froglet on shore → adult frog.\n\nLayout and subject placement\n- Aspect ratio: 3:2 horizontal. Resolution target: 2048×1365 or higher.\n- Camera angle: very low, slightly above the waterline, using a half‑submerged housing so the frame shows both underwater and shoreline seamlessly.\n- Left 20% (Stage 1 – eggs): A dense clump of gelatinous frogspawn on submerged vegetation, each egg a clear sphere with a single black embryo; sparkling surface highlights and a thin film of pond water. Match the look and density of the egg mass to reference image_0.\n- Center‑left 20% (Stage 2 – tadpoles): A small school of dark tadpoles swimming over pale stones and sand, some casting sharp silhouettes on a light rock. Use the rock-and-silhouette feel from reference image_1.\n- Center‑right 20% (Stage 3 – legged tadpole): One large tadpole resting on a pale rock, with clearly visible hind legs and small emerging forelimbs; tail still long and flexible. Shape and pose echo reference image_1, but brighter, more detailed.\n- Right 15% (Stage 4 – froglet): A tiny froglet just out of the water on a wet leaf at the shoreline; smooth moist skin, bright eyes, a small residual tail nub.\n- Far‑right background 10% (Adult): An adult frog half on a mossy rock, half in the water, slightly defocused so the focus remains on the froglet.\n- Negative space and continuity: Submerged reeds and algae guide the eye left→right; gentle ripples unify the water surface.\n\nEnvironment and materials\n- Setting: clear, shallow freshwater pond with sandy bottom, scattered pebbles, one pale limestone rock mid‑frame; sparse submerged grasses.\n- Water: clean with faint suspended particulates, small air bubbles clinging to eggs and rock edges; subtle caustic light patterns on the stones.\n- Shore: wet leaf litter, a few blades of green grass, dark soil.\n\nLighting and color\n- Time of day: late morning, bright overcast with soft dappled sun through foliage.\n- Key light: soft natural sunlight from upper left; use a polarizing look to reduce surface glare while keeping specular highlights on eggs.\n- Color palette: natural greens and browns; eggs translucent with bluish‑gray shadows; tadpoles near‑black; rocks warm beige.\n\nCamera and lens behavior\n- Real camera look, full‑frame sensor.\n- Focal length: 35 mm.\n- Aperture: f/8–f/11 for moderate depth-of-field; employ subtle focus stacking so all five stages remain acceptably sharp.\n- Shutter: 1/250 s; ISO 200.\n- Depth cues: stronger micro‑contrast and texture on the central rock; slight bokeh in distant shoreline.\n\nImage quality and style\n- Style: documentary macro‑environment photograph, not an illustration; crisp textures, fine water details, true‑to‑life colors.\n- Detail: high micro‑detail on egg capsules, tadpole skin, and froglet skin; visible pores and water droplets.\n- No text labels in the frame unless requested.\n\nReference bindings\n- Use image_0 to guide the appearance and clustering of the frogspawn (gelatinous capsules with black embryos).\n- Use image_1 to guide the rock setting and the silhouette/shape of tadpoles and the legged tadpole on the rock.\n\nNegative prompts\n- No cartoons, paintings, CGI, or infographic icons.\n- No unnatural colors, no overly shallow DOF that blurs any lifecycle stage, no extra animals, no murky water, no heavy lens flares, no human‑made objects.\n\nOptional generation parameters\n- CFG/Guidance: 6.5–8.5\n- Sampler: DPM++ or Euler a\n- Steps: 30–50\n- Seed: fixed for repeatability (e.g., 12345)\n\nOne‑line prompt (if your T2I system prefers a single string)\n“Ultra‑realistic natural history photo, low angle at a shallow pond edge, continuous left‑to‑right frog life cycle: dense translucent frogspawn with black embryos underwater (match ref image_0), then a school of dark tadpoles over a pale rock casting silhouettes (match ref image_1), then a tadpole with hind legs resting on the rock, then a tiny froglet on a wet leaf at the shoreline with a small tail nub, and an adult frog slightly defocused on a mossy rock in the background; clear freshwater with bubbles and caustic patterns, reeds and pebbles, bright overcast dappled sunlight, natural greens/browns; full‑frame 35 mm, f/8–f/11, slight focus stacking, polarized look, high detail, documentary photo, no text, no CGI.”",
