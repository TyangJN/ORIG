Eggs — gelatinous egg mass in water with visible yolk embryos. No limbs or gills yet.\n2. Embryo / hatching — embryo curled in egg; then hatch into a tadpole (early larval stage).\n3. Early tadpole — elongated body with long tail used for swimming; external gill filaments often visible right after hatching (in many species these are prominent briefly).\n4. Larval tadpole (feeding stage) — tail large and finned; gills become enclosed in a gill chamber (internal gills under an opercular fold in most frogs); mouth has a small beak/keratinized rows for scraping algae; herbivorous gut is long.\n5. Limb-bud stage — hindlimb buds appear first (small protrusions on the rear flank), then elongate into legs with toes; forelimbs develop later and typically remain hidden inside the gill/chamber until emergence.\n6. Metamorphic climax — forelimbs emerge (often suddenly); lungs develop and gills regress; tail shortens rapidly (resorption), dorsal head/eye position and mouth broaden, digestive tract shortens as diet shifts to carnivory.\n7. Froglet / juvenile — four fully formed limbs, small tail stump or absent; air-breathing; more adult skin texture.\n8. Adult frog — no external tail, four limbs, developed lungs, adult body proportions.\n\nKey visible anatomical transitions and order (essential)\n- Gill transition: external gill filaments present very early → gills become internal/enclosed under an opercular fold in most tadpoles → gills are resorbed during metamorphosis as lungs develop.\n- Limb emergence order: hindlimbs appear first (buds → toes form) → forelimbs develop later and are often hidden until they protrude.\n- Tail resorption: tail is longest in larval stages, then shortens and is reabsorbed during metamorphosis (tail loss is one of the final visible changes).\n- Other visible changes: mouth widens (from scraping beak to broad adult mouth), eyes move dorsally and become more prominent, skin thickens, body shape shortens and becomes more frog-like, gut shortens.\n\nVisual cues to emphasize for realism in a single image/sequence\n- Arrange 5–7 panels showing progression: egg mass → early tadpole with external gill filaments → tadpole with large tail + hindlimb buds → tadpole with developed hindlimbs + hidden forelimbs (or forelimb emerging) → metamorphic climax with shrinking tail → froglet with small tail stub → adult frog.\n- Distinguishing features per panel: gill filaments vs enclosed gill chamber, presence/size of hindlimbs, timing of forelimb emergence, tail length and fining, mouth shape change.\n- Habitat context: shallow pond/water with aquatic plants for eggs/tadpoles; partial emergence onto land for metamorph and froglet; adult on land or at water edge.\n- Color/texture notes: tadpoles typically darker along the dorsum and translucent tail fin; adult skin textured and patterned, lighter belly.\n\nUse these key, ordered visual markers to accurately depict frog metamorphosis and the gill→lung transition."

      "coarse_filtered_content": "Photorealistic frog life cycle in a pond setting. Arrange 5–7 panels in a circular ring or left-to-right sequence, progressing from fully submerged scenes to the water’s edge/land. Include shallow water, submerged plants and reeds, lily pads, and surface reflections; maintain realistic scale differences (tiny eggs, small tadpoles, thumb-sized froglets, larger adults).\n\nStages and key visual cues:\n- Egg mass (frogspawn): translucent jelly clumps floating/attached in shallow water; visible black yolks/embryos, some curled/comma-shaped.\n- Hatching embryo / early tadpole: tiny body with external filamentous gills beside the egg mass; small translucent tail fin.\n- Larval tadpole (internal gills): dark dorsal coloring; large, high tail fin; gills enclosed under an opercular fold; forelimbs hidden; shown underwater among plants.\n- Limb‑bud stage: hindlimb buds appear and elongate first; rear toes forming; tail remains large.\n- Metamorphic climax: sudden forelimb emergence from the gill chamber; rapid tail shrinkage/resorption as lungs develop.\n- Froglet: small four‑limbed frog with a short tail stump; positioned half in water on a wet rock or leaf near the edge.\n- Adult frog: fully formed with moist skin; perched on a lily pad or pond bank.\n\nRealism details to emphasize:\n- Jelly translucency and embedded black embryos in eggs.\n- External gill filaments on early tadpoles; later opercular fold indicating internal gills and previously hidden forelimbs.\n- Tail fin translucency and textures of tail resorption/shrinking during climax.\n- Habitat shift from submerged plants to emergent vegetation and land as stages progress."
