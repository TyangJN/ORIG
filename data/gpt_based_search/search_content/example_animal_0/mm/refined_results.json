  "mm_refined_results": "<TextContent>\n- Key visual/textual elements for generation control\n  - 5–7 panels showing frog life cycle in a pond, progressing from fully submerged scenes to water’s edge/land.\n  - Realistic pond habitat: shallow water, submerged plants and reeds, sandy/silty bottom, lily pads, emergent vegetation, natural surface reflections and ripples.\n  - Accurate morphology at each stage: egg jelly translucency with black embryos; external filamentous gills on hatchlings; opercular fold covering internal gills on larval tadpoles (forelimbs hidden); hindlimb buds progressing to toes; forelimbs appear suddenly during metamorphic climax; tail fin translucency and tail resorption textures; froglet with tail stump; adult with moist skin.\n  - Realistic scale differences: eggs tiny; early tadpoles very small; larval tadpoles larger with big fins; froglets thumb-sized; adults substantially larger. Maintain proportional scaling across panels.\n  - Visual flow indicators: subtle arrows or numbered labels to guide sequence.\n\n- Style, composition, detail requirements\n  - Photorealistic, nature-documentary look; soft natural daylight (morning or overcast), visible caustics underwater, gentle surface speculars.\n  - Water realism: suspended particulates, micro-bubbles around eggs/hatching, slight turbidity in deeper panels, accurate refraction and reflections at the surface.\n  - Macro-to-close views for small stages; mid-shot for froglet; wider for adult on lily pad/bank. Consistent color palette: pond greens, olive-browns, amber water, muted neutrals.\n  - Clean scientific readability: one primary subject per panel, shallow depth of field that keeps the subject sharp and background softly blurred.\n\n- Spatial relationships and layout specifications\n  - Arrangement option A (circular ring): 6 panels around a ring, clockwise flow from 4–5 o’clock (deep/shallow water) up to 12–1 o’clock (surface) and to 2–3 o’clock (edge/land).\n  - Arrangement option B (left-to-right strip): leftmost panels fully submerged; middle panels near surface; rightmost panels at the edge/land.\n  - Depth gradient: early stages deepest; gradual shallowing toward froglet/adult. Include background reeds rising toward surface, and emergent stems near later panels.\n  - Scale and spacing: allow consistent relative sizing; include a few repeated environmental anchors (same reed cluster/lily pad type) to imply single pond.\n\n- Detailed scene description with controllable elements\n  - Panel 1: Egg mass (frogspawn)\n    - Shallow water macro view; jelly clumps attached to submerged reed/stem near light-dappled surface.\n    - Translucent gel with embedded black embryos; a few embryos curled/comma-shaped.\n    - Tiny air bubbles on jelly; slight surface reflection overhead.\n  - Panel 2: Hatching embryo / early tadpole\n    - Close-up beside egg mass; one hatchling partly emerged.\n    - External filamentous gills (fine reddish/transparent fronds) behind head; small translucent tail fin.\n    - A few empty/ruptured egg capsules nearby.\n  - Panel 3: Larval tadpole (internal gills)\n    - Underwater mid-shot among submerged plants; darker dorsal coloration; large high tail fin.\n    - Opercular fold visible covering gills; forelimbs not visible; mouth grazing on biofilm on a leaf or rock.\n  - Panel 4: Limb‑bud stage\n    - Two tadpoles at mid-depth; hindlimb buds elongating with early toes forming; tail still large and translucent fin.\n    - Positioned near vertical reed stems; slight schooling behavior.\n  - Panel 5: Metamorphic climax\n    - Near-surface angle; one juvenile with forelimb emerging from gill chamber (fold opening), tail shrinking with uneven translucent edges (resorption).\n    - Tiny bubble at mouth hinting first air gulp; rippled surface and reflection above.\n  - Panel 6: Froglet\n    - Half-in/half-out at pond edge; perched on wet rock or leaf with water droplets; short tail stump.\n    - Emergent grasses and mud bank visible; soft reflection in still water.\n  - Panel 7 (optional if using 7 panels): Adult frog\n    - Fully formed adult with moist skin; perched on lily pad or pond bank; clear reflection on water surface; distant lily pads and reeds in background.\n\n</TextContent>\n\n<ImageAnalysis>\nimage_0:\n  Preserve:\n  - Clear cyclical progression cue (arrows or numbered sequence) to communicate life cycle flow.\n  - Inclusion of lily pad for adult stage and submerged reeds/plants for early stages.\n  - Distinct depiction of multiple stages in one composition.\n  Ignore:\n  - Cartoon/illustrative rendering style, heavy outlines, and exaggerated anatomy.\n  - Spherical “aquarium” container motif; use natural pond instead.\n  - Bright red arrows dominating the scene; replace with subtle, minimal indicators.\n  - Simplified textures and uniform backgrounds; replace with photoreal water, sediment, and reflections.\n</ImageAnalysis>\n\n<GenerationGuidance>\nInteraction Control:\n- Subject-subject interactions\n  - Tadpoles loosely schooling; one individual highlighted per panel.\n  - Froglet not interacting with adult; stages shown separately to avoid confusion.\n- Subject-object interactions\n  - Eggs attached to reed/stem; jelly wraps around stem.\n  - Early tadpole emerging from egg capsule; contact with jelly strands.\n  - Larval tadpole grazing biofilm on leaf/rock; tail fin brushing vegetation.\n  - Metamorphic juvenile breaking opercular fold as forelimb emerges; proximity to surface film.\n  - Froglet gripping wet rock/leaf; water beads on toes and skin.\n  - Adult crouched on lily pad or bank; pad depresses slightly under weight, creating a meniscus and concentric ripples.\n- Environmental interactions\n  - Light caustics and dappled sunlight patterns moving over bodies and substrate.\n  - Surface reflections of sky/reeds; mild wind ripples; occasional suspended detritus drifting.\n\nSpatial Control:\n- Precise positioning and relationships\n  - Sequence left-to-right or clockwise: deep/shallow water → near-surface → edge/land.\n  - Keep eggs within 5–15 cm of surface; adult on lily pad at surface; froglet at waterline.\n  - Maintain consistent reed cluster geometry across panels to imply same pond.\n- Depth layers and scale proportions\n  - Foreground subject sharp; midground plants soft; distant reeds and darker water mass in background.\n  - Scale hierarchy: egg capsule ~3–5 mm; hatchling body ~6–10 mm; larval tadpole larger with tail length 2–3× body; froglet thumb-sized; adult significantly larger but within realistic species size.\n- Movement and directional flow\n  - Subtle arrows or numbered captions; swimming tadpoles oriented forward-left or forward-right to guide flow.\n  - Gentle fin undulation implied by motion blur only at tail tip; no exaggerated motion.\n\nScene Control:\n- Environmental context and elements\n  - Sandy/silty bottom with scattered pebbles; periphytic algae on rocks and plant stems.\n  - Submerged plants (pondweed), vertical reeds; patches of lily pads at surface; emergent grasses at edge.\n- Atmospheric conditions and lighting\n  - Overcast-bright or golden-hour soft light; low contrast underwater haze; realistic refraction at air-water interface.\n  - Slight turbidity; microbubbles near eggs/hatching; faint backscatter specks in deeper panels.\n- Props, furniture, architectural details\n  - Optional label cards or minimal white arrows; avoid lab equipment or aquarium glass artifacts.\n  - Wet rock/leaf for froglet; intact lily pad for adult with visible veins.\n\nStyle Control:\n- Visual style and aesthetic direction\n  - Photorealistic, natural-history/field-guide aesthetic; high fidelity textures and anatomy.\n- Color palette and mood\n  - Natural greens/olives, brown silt, amber water, muted sky reflections; avoid neon saturation.\n- Composition and framing\n  - One dominant subject per panel; balanced negative space; rule-of-thirds placement.\n  - Macro lenses for early stages; moderate focal lengths for later stages; consistent viewpoint height per panel.\n\nPriority Elements:\n- Most critical control points, ranked by importance\n  1) Accurate stage-specific anatomy (external gills → opercular fold; hindlimb buds; forelimb emergence; tail resorption; tail stump).\n  2) Correct habitat shift and depth progression from underwater to edge/land.\n  3) Realistic scale relationships among stages.\n  4) Water realism (translucent jelly, tail fin translucency, surface reflections/meniscus, caustics).\n  5) Clear sequence readability (circular or left-to-right) with subtle indicators.\n- Negative constraints: avoid\n  - Cartoon style, heavy outlines, spherical “bowl” framing, and oversized arrows.\n  - Showing forelimbs on larval tadpoles before metamorphic climax; missing opercular fold; wrong gill type per stage.\n  - Unnatural colors, overly clear aquarium water, or glass reflections; fish or unrelated species in panels.\n  - Mixed habitats in single panel that break progression logic (e.g., adult underwater, eggs on land).\n</GenerationGuidance>",

  "prompts": "<final_prompt>\nPhotorealistic natural‑history composite of a frog life cycle: 7 side‑by‑side panels in a left‑to‑right strip, all within one natural pond. Soft overcast daylight; underwater caustics and mild haze; pond palette of olive greens, amber water, brown silt. Maintain one consistent reed cluster and lily‑pad patch across panels to imply the same location. Subtle white numbered labels (1–7) and small arrows guide the sequence, inspired by <image_0>, but minimal and unobtrusive.\n\nEnvironment and optics: shallow water to waterside depth gradient from left to right; sandy/silty bottom with scattered pebbles and periphytic algae; submerged pondweed and vertical reeds; surface reflections and gentle ripples. One dominant subject per panel; shallow depth of field with subject crisp, background softly blurred. Macro/close lenses for early stages, moderate focal lengths for froglet/adult.\n\nPanel 1 (macro, near surface): frogspawn jelly mass wrapped around a submerged reed 5–15 cm below the surface; translucent gel with embedded black embryos, a few comma‑curled; tiny air bubbles on the jelly; overhead surface reflection. \nPanel 2 (macro): hatchling emerging from a capsule beside the egg mass; fine external filamentous gills behind the head (reddish/transparent); small translucent tail fin; several ruptured capsules nearby, suspended microbubbles. \nPanel 3 (underwater mid‑shot): larval tadpole among plants, darker dorsum; large high tail fin; opercular fold covering internal gills; no forelimbs visible; mouth grazing biofilm on a leaf/rock. \nPanel 4 (mid‑depth): two tadpoles loosely schooling near vertical reeds; hindlimb buds elongating with early toes; big translucent tail fins. \nPanel 5 (near surface): metamorphic climax; forelimb emerging from the gill chamber as the fold opens; tail shrinking with uneven translucent edges; tiny bubble at mouth; rippled surface and reflection above. \nPanel 6 (waterline): froglet perched half‑in/half‑out on a wet rock or leaf; short tail stump; water beads on toes; emergent grasses and mud bank. \nPanel 7 (surface): adult frog on an intact lily pad; moist skin; pad slightly depressed with a meniscus and concentric ripples; clear reflection.\n\nScale hierarchy: eggs 3–5 mm; hatchling body 6–10 mm; larval tadpoles larger with tails 2–3× body; froglet thumb‑sized; adult substantially larger. Gentle tail‑tip motion blur only; tadpoles oriented forward to lead the flow.\n\nAvoid: cartoon/illustrative look, heavy outlines, spherical aquarium/bowl framing, bright red dominant arrows, unnatural neon colors, glass reflections, crystal‑clear aquarium water, fish or unrelated species, mixing habitats (e.g., adult underwater), incorrect anatomy (no forelimbs before metamorphic climax; show opercular fold and correct gill stages).\n</final_prompt>"
